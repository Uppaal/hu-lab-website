# Hu Lab Website (GitHub Pages)

This repository contains the source code for the lab website, hosted via GitHub Pages and built using Jekyll. 

The site is data-driven where possible (people, publications), so most updates do not require editing HTML.

The website can currently be accessed at:
```
https://uppaal.github.io/lab-website/
```

## Deployment (One-Time)

The site is deployed via GitHub Pages.
- Repository: `lab-website`
- Deployment: `Settings` → `Pages` → `Deploy` from main branch (root)
- Live URL: `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/lab-website/`
  - Or custom domain if configured

**Important:** This site depends on Jekyll. Do not add a `.nojekyll` file.
