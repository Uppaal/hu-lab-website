## Prospective PhD students
 
**(Updated on Aug 8 2025)**

Thanks for your interest! I may not be able to reply to all inquiries due to the large amounts of emails. If you still want to bring my attention to your papers by email, please add 
<span class="text-highlight">“[prospective student to Hulab]”</span> in the email subject. 
I’ll update hiring information on my website. 
<span class="text-highlight">I am looking for 1 or 2 creative and curiosity-driven PhD students to join our lab in the fall of 2025.</span>
The admission decision at UW-Madison is committee-based. 
Please apply to the [CS](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/graduate/graduate-admissions-faq/) program, and mention my name in your application and research statement. UW-Madison is an excellent place for research, and Madison is a wonderful city to live in.

## Prospective MS/BS students and Interns
I’m also happy to work with master’s or undergraduate students at UW-Madison. If you are a currently UW student, please email me your CV. At the beginging of some semesters, I typically send an email to the CS mailing list to find students for research projects. Selected candidates will participate in a brief interview and will be paired with one of my PhD students. For international students, I consider only exceptional candidates with closely aligned research interests. 
Please contact me at least <span class="text-highlight">5 months before your onsite internship</span> to allow time for paperwork and review the [J-1 student internship](https://iss.wisc.edu/j-1-student-interns/) program requirements.
